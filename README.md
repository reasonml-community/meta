# reasonml-community meta repository

This repository contains information about the organization, its purpose and how it works. This document in particular (README.md) is the official agreed-upon documentation of the community. The wiki may hold less-official information and the issues are for discussion and individual opinion.

## Rules

These are the current rules, as decided on in [#1](https://github.com/reasonml-community/meta/issues/1):

* Every repository should have a single _responsible_ maintainer.
* Maintainers volunteer, and are accepted if at least three (3) existing members agree.
* The organization is made up of the maintainers. Any member that seizes to be a maintainer should therefore be removed.
* Decisions are made based on absolute majority vote. That is, if a majority of the members, present or not, have voted for a decision.
* Decisions should ideally be reached via consensus, that is without dissent, but if that fails and a decision needs to be made an absolute majority vote decides.
